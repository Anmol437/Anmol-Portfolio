<P>Travelling is an amazing way to learn a lot of things in life.<br> A lot of people around the world travel every year to many places.
<br>Moreover, it is important to travel to humans. <br>Some travel to learn more while some travel to take break from their life.<br>
No matters the reason, travelling opens a big door for us to explore the world beyond imagination<br> and indulge in differnt places.

<pre> Owl is my favourite bird. <br> The thing I find very interesting about them is that owls can see only at <br> night, and in the day, they lose their ability to see.
